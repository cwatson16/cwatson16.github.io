For the sample porfolio I created for an assigment thru the Tech Academy, I used the Rubik's glitch font in bold black for the headers on each page, Rubik standard font for the small 'about me' section, and a light beige colored background to keep it minimal. This sample is a rotating design to experiment with different layouts and color schemes and will be updated often. I removed all previously utilized JS to keep each page static and changed the overall layout, colors, and font as of 4/1/22.
